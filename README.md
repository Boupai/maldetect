# maldetect

  This program is used to detect if a cell is infected with malaria or not. As, you may already know, humans make lots of errors whether, its math or just what we see. What our program does is transfer the job of detecting malaria from people to computers. This makes the process easier for humans, with the benefit of almost always higher accuracy. Thuis program could prove very useful in medical fields and in places less developed, which could use my program to diagnos many cells at a time.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm is working to classify a cell as infected or uninfected. The algorithm does this by being trained by many pictures of parasitized and uninfected pictures of cells, which is classified before by a human, so the computer can correctly classify the image. This whole process is done before putting in new images in, so the computer can learn what malaria looks like, before making a decision.  There were only two options for the computer to chose as a cell either has malaria or does not.
